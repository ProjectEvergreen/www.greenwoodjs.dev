# About

Greenwood's goal is to bring the power of modern development to the web we all know and love. For those who still want the option to just start with an HTML file, Greenwood aims to be a faithful and authentic gateway to the web platform and web friendly JavaScript runtimes. It's why we consider Greenwood your _**workbench**_ for the web, and not a framework per se; we don't mind going vanilla. 🍦

> Whether you are building a blog or a single page application, a hobby project or passion project, we encourage you to give Greenwood a try!

## Features

Some of Greenwood's feature include:

- Unbundled local development flow, with `E-Tags` headers, for efficient caching and live reloads
- Out of the box support for ESM and Web APIs, on both the client and server
- Server Side Rendering of Web Components (Light and Shadow DOM)
- API Routes
- Automatic code splitting through user defined `<script>` and `<link>` tags
- Self-host, or deploy to your favorite hosting platform
- Build with friends like Lit, Tailwind, and more!
- Hybrid rendering strategies (CSR, SSR, SSG, or mix and match!)
- Extensible through plugins

Greenwood aims to be a low point of friction as part of a general purpose web development workflow, and will strive to find a good balance between what tools and dependencies are considered core to Greenwood. We hope to avoid the common "meta" framework paradigm and instead want to hone in on a lean and efficient core with good extension points and output adaptability.

## Goals

First and foremost, Greenwood recognizes that too much magic and trust in _node_modules_ can be both a blessing and a curse, and Greenwood wants to help you walk that line a little more safely. If there is a web standard, you can be assured it's supported by Greenwood out of the box, if not turned into an entire API! We want Greenwood to be a project that everyone can use without pre-existing knowledge of libraries and frameworks. Start with an _index.html_ and work your way up to a completely server rendered application if you need!

As the web grows and evolves, so will Greenwood. We are active collaborators in the [WCCG (Web Components Community Group)](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents-cg) and participant in initiatives like the [Interop Project](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop) and [TPAC](https://www.w3.org/news-events/w3c-tpac/).

If we did our job well, the only docs you should need are [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/).

## Roadmap

The Greenwood team are working hard towards a [1.0 release](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/milestone/3) and are eager to get there quickly and provide a stable foundation to expand Greenwood's features and capabilities. We want to make sure Greenwood is the best experience it can be, for users and developers. If you have [any issues](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/issues) or are curious to see what we're [working on next](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/projects), please feel free to checkout our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood) and poke around.
