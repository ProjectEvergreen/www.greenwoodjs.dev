# GraphQL

For GraphQL support, please see our [**GraphQL plugin**](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/tree/master/packages/plugin-graphql) which in additional to exposing an [Apollo server and playground](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) locally at `http://localhost:4000`, also provides GraphQL alternatives to our [Data Client](/docs/content-as-data/data-client/) through a customized (read only) Apollo client based wrapper.
