  <p><strong>Greenwood</strong> generally does not have any opinion on how you structure your site, aside from the pre-defined <em>pages</em> and (optional) <em>layouts/</em> directories. It supports all standard files that you can open in a web browser.</p>
</app-heading-box>

In this section we'll cover common web formats and languages supported by Greenwood, including:

- [JavaScript](/docs/resources/scripts/)
- [CSS](/docs/resources/styles/)
- [Assets](/docs/resources/assets/)
- [TypeScript](/docs/resources/typescript/)
