## What's New

A new Greenwood release is here! As per the usual round of enhancements and bug fixes, we are excited to highlight a few of the key features available in this release. These highlights include native TypeScript support (no longer experimental!), an overhaul of Greenwood's new project init scaffolding, and a new standalone markdown plugin. The new minimum version of NodeJS has now been bumped to `>= 22.18.0`.

This release also continues our effort to improved ecosystem compatibility with fixes for our Adapter plugins and improved import map generation handling. Thank you so much to everyone who got involved with us for this release including two new first-time contributors! It means a lot to us and we appreciate your support of Greenwood! üíö

> Please refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/releases/tag/v0.33.0) for the complete changelog and overview of breaking changes.

## Native TypeScript Support

With NodeJS `22.18.0`, TypeScript support in Greenwood is no longer experimental and requires no flags.

```json5
// before
{
  scripts: {
    build: "'NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-strip-types' greenwood build",
  },
}
```

```json5
// after
{
  scripts: {
    build: "greenwood build",
  },
}
```

We've also formalized our [_tsconfig.json_ settings](/docs/resources/typescript/#setup), updating our required options and recommended settings, which you can see below.

```json5
{
  compilerOptions: {
    // minimum required configuration
    target: "es2020",
    module: "preserve",
    moduleResolution: "bundler",
    allowImportingTsExtensions: true,
    noEmit: true,

    // additional recommended configuration
    lib: ["ES2020", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
    verbatimModuleSyntax: true,
    erasableSyntaxOnly: true,
  },

  exclude: ["./public/", "./greenwood/", "node_modules"],
}
```

Don't want to set this all up yourself? We've got you, this is all automatically generated through Greenwood init scaffolding CLI. Wait, TypeScript in the init CLI? Yes, you heard that correctly, so let's tell you all about it! üëá

## Init Scaffolding

The Init scaffolding CLI has been improved to be a more robust, prompt based experience, which will walk you through selecting a number of scaffolding options for your project. Now when scaffolding out a new Greenwood project, you're now able to specify name / output directory, TypeScript support, and package manager installation.

It's as easy as running:

```shell
$ npx @greenwood/init@latest
```

As all the prompted options are available as CLI flags, if you know what you want, you can one shot the entire scaffolding all in one command! For example, to automatically create and name a project with TypeScript and PNPM, you could use this command:

```shell
$ npx @greenwood/init@latest --name my-app --ts --i pnpm
```

> Check out our [Init setup docs](/docs/introduction/setup/#init) to see the full list of options.

## Standalone Markdown Plugin

Although a breaking change, we've made the decision to move markdown support outside of the Greenwood CLI and into its own plugin, still based on the [**unified**](https://unifiedjs.com/) ecosystem. There were a few motivations for this change:

- Markdown support required _seven_ dependencies, which is a lot for something not every project might need.
- There are many flavors and implementations of markdown, and so this allows any user to swap out the implementation with their own preference.
- It validates in a meaningful way that any file format could become a custom page format, like YAML or JSON.

Upgrading is super easy, just install **@greenwood/plugin-markdown** and add it your Greenwood configuration file, and pass any markdown plugins as options to the plugin.

```js
// before
export default {
  markdown: {
    plugins: ["@mapbox/rehype-prism", "rehype-autolink-headings", "remark-gfm"],
  },
};
```

```js
// after
import { greenwoodPluginMarkdown } from "@greenwood/plugin-markdown";

export default {
  plugins: [
    greenwoodPluginMarkdown({
      plugins: ["@mapbox/rehype-prism", "rehype-autolink-headings", "remark-gfm"],
    }),
  ],
};
```

> Check out [the (new) docs page](/docs/plugins/markdown/) for all information on adopting the plugin.

## Honorable Mentions

In addition to these key features, there are some additional items we would like to callout:

- Fixed some issues where SSR pages were not participating in the layout / paging merging hierarchy, in which SSR pages didn't merge correctly into page and / or app layouts. However, there was also a breaking change as part of this in which Greenwood has now removed default layouts and pages content.
- Greenwood now supports bare CSS `@import` specifiers for packages that have export maps. So now, something like this would work; `@import "open-props/sizes";`
- Made enhancements to more efficiently generate SSR pages and layout contents from renderer plugins, to avoid over-rendering when it isn't needed.
- Refactoring effort to enable greater concurrency in Greenwood's asset bundling and page generation and pre-rendering operations (thank you kind contributor! üèÜ).
