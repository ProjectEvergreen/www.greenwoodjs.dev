# Walkthrough

Now that we have covered some of the [basics](/guides/getting-started/key-concepts/) and have our project [ready to go](/guides/getting-started/#setup), let's start building!

In this section, we'll walk through developing a site with Greenwood and making some content. We'll provide all the code so you can just follow along if you want. By the end, you'll have a simple website that you can build and deploy to any web server or hosting provider you like. What you do from there, is all up to you!

> Feel free to follow along with our [companion repo](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood-getting-started) as you work through this section.

## Local Development

First let's get the development server running. We can open this in our browser and get instant live reloading as we making changes, so we can see our work come alive in real-time.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<app-ctc-block variant="runners">

  ```shell
  npm run dev
  ```

  ```shell
  yarn dev
  ```

  ```shell
  pnpm dev
  ```

</app-ctc-block>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Congrats, you should have your first **Greenwood** site running at `http://localhost:1984`, though it will be quite empty at first.

Let's change that!

## Creating Content

The heart of any website is its content. So let's build out some pages and layouts and get some content on the screen.

### Pages

Let's scaffold out a couple pages to get things going. For this guide, we'll want the following:

- A home page
- Two blog post pages

Our home page will be simple landing page with links to our blog post pages:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<app-ctc-block variant="snippet" heading="src/pages/index.html">

  ```html
  <html>
    <body>
      <h1>Welcome</h1>

      <p>Thanks for visiting my site, I hope you like it!</p>

      <h2>My Posts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/blog/first-post/">My First Post</a></li>
        <li><a href="/blog/second-post/">My Second Post</a></li>
      </ul>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

</app-ctc-block>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

For the blog post pages, let's create a folder called _blog/_ in our pages directory and then create two markdown files called _first-post.md_ and _second-post.md_:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<app-ctc-block variant="snippet" heading="src/pages/blog/first-post.md">

  ```md
  # My First Blog Post

  Lorem Ipsum...
  ```

</app-ctc-block>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<app-ctc-block variant="snippet" heading="src/pages/blog/second-post.md">

  ```md
  # My Second Blog Post

  Sed ut perspiciatis...
  ```

</app-ctc-block>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Layouts

Now that we have some pages, let's think about how we want organize the layout of our pages. For this guide, we will create the following layouts:

1. _app.html_ - This will be the layout we'll use to wrap all pages with our common styles and components (which we'll add in the next chapter)
1. _blog.html_ - This will be a layout specific to blog pages, which we'll configure using frontmatter

#### App Layout

To provide a wrapper to put all our common styles and components in, let's create a _src/layouts/app.html_ file with this starting HTML. We'll include a basic `<title>` and `<meta>` and the `<page-outlet>` tag as a placeholder for where the page contents will go.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<app-ctc-block variant="snippet" heading="src/layouts/app.html">

  ```html
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>My Blog</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My personal blog built with Greenwood." />
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    </head>

    <body>
      <main>
        <page-outlet></page-outlet>
      </main>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

</app-ctc-block>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

#### Blog Posts Layout

For the individual blog posts, we're going to want a custom layout for those pages. So what do we do? Just create a new layout!

Create a _src/layouts/blog.html_ file, including our `<content-outlet>` placeholder tag for our markdown content, and some links to help with navigating our site:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<app-ctc-block variant="snippet" heading="src/layouts/blog.html">

  ```html
  <html>
    <body>
      <article>
        <content-outlet></content-outlet>
      </article>

      <hr />

      <h3>More Posts</h3>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/blog/first-post/">My First Post</a></li>
          <li><a href="/blog/second-post/">My Second Post</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

</app-ctc-block>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

> In case you don't see the layout effects taking place for the blog pages, you may need to restart the dev server for [frontmatter changes to take effect](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/issues/1278).

## Styling

OK, so we've made some content which you should see reflected in your browser, but what about the look and feel? Yes, of course, let's add some CSS!

Let's make a _src/styles/theme.css_ for our global styles and variables, which we can then reference in any of our layouts, pages, or components.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<app-ctc-block variant="snippet" heading="src/styles/theme.css">

  ```css
  @import url("//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro&display=swap");

  * {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    text-decoration: none;
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }

  body {
    font-family: "Source Sans Pro", sans-serif;
    line-height: 1.4;
  }

  :root {
    --color-accent: #016341;
    --color-link: #1d337a;
  }

  h2 {
    color: var(--color-accent);
    font-size: 2rem;
    margin: 5px 0;
  }

  a {
    color: var(--color-link);
  }
  ```

</app-ctc-block>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Now we can add a `<link>` tag pointing to this CSS file into our _app.html_ layout. Easy! ðŸ’¥

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<app-ctc-block variant="snippet" heading="src/layouts/app.html">

  ```html
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>My Blog</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My personal blog built with Greenwood." />
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="../styles/theme.css" />
    </head>

    <body>
      <!-- ... -->
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

</app-ctc-block>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

> Referencing the [companion repo](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood-getting-started), go ahead and create a CSS file each for the home page and blog styles and `<link>` those up in their respective HTML files.

## Components

To create the header and footer for our site, we'll be using [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction). Web Components are the web platform's [native way](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) to create custom HTML behaviors that (can) encapsulate their own styles, are light weight, and make for a great templating solution.

Combined with [Declarative Shadow DOM](https://web.dev/articles/declarative-shadow-dom), Web Components can also benefit from SSR and can tap into hydration techniques that are all built in to the browser!

Let's use the footer component for this guide as an example:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<app-ctc-block variant="snippet" heading="src/components/footer/footer.js">

  ```js
  const template = document.createElement("template");

  export default class FooterComponent extends HTMLElement {
    connectedCallback() {
      const year = new Date().getFullYear();

      if (!this.shadowRoot) {
        template.innerHTML = `
          <style>
            .footer {
              position: fixed;
              bottom: 0;
              width: 100%;
              background-color: var(--color-bg);
              min-height: 30px;
              padding-top: 10px;

              & a {
                color: #efefef;
                text-decoration: none;
              }

              & h4 {
                width: 90%;
                margin: 0 auto;
                padding: 0;
                text-align: center;
              }
            }
          </style>
          <footer class="footer">
            <h4>
              <a href="https://www.greenwoodjs.io/">My Blog &copy;${year} &#9672 Built with GreenwoodJS</a>
            </h4>
          </footer>
        `;

        this.attachShadow({ mode: "open" });
        this.shadowRoot.appendChild(template.content.cloneNode(true));
      }
    }
  }

  customElements.define("app-footer", FooterComponent);
  ```

</app-ctc-block>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

What we've done is:

1. Create a `FooterComponent` class that extends `HTMLElement`
1. If no shadow root is detected, create a `<template>` element
1. We add some styles and HTML into the template
1. We instantiate a shadow root and append that to the template
1. We then define a tag for our new `<app-footer>` and pass a reference to our class

From there, we can reference this in our App layout with a `<script>` tag and then add the `<app-footer>` tag to the bottom of the layout:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

<app-ctc-block variant="snippet" heading="src/layouts/app.html">

  ```html
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>My Blog</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My personal blog built with Greenwood." />
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="../styles/theme.css" />
      <script type="module" src="../components/footer.js"></script>
    </head>

    <body>
      <main>
        <page-outlet></page-outlet>
      </main>

      <app-footer></app-footer>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

</app-ctc-block>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

> Now you can do the same for an `<app-header>`. See the [companion repo](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood-getting-started/) for a complete working example. Voila! All our pages now have a header and footer! ðŸŽ‰

## Final Build

Now that we have all our content everything we developed working, we should generate a production build and verify that output locally. For that, we just need to run Greenwood's `build` command, followed by its `serve` command:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<app-ctc-block variant="runners">

  ```shell
  npm run build && npm run serve
  ```

  ```shell
  yarn build && yarn serve
  ```

  ```shell
  pnpm build && pnpm serve
  ```

</app-ctc-block>

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

If all goes well, you should be able to open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser and see a result similar to this:

## Next Section

Phew!

Good work, now you have a Greenwood project ready to [publish and deploy](/guides/hosting/). Before we wrap up, let's explore a few ways you can [take Greenwood further](/guides/getting-started/going-further/) by demonstrating some additional use cases.
