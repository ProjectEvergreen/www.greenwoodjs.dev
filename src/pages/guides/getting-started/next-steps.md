# Next Steps

Before closing out this guide, we hope you have gotten to get a good overview of Greenwood and its mechanics and how rooted Greenwood is in the web. This is why we say Greenwood is **your workbench for web**; we want to _enable you to build however you want, with whatever you want, and wherever you want_. Go all vanilla, or bring some friends along. Either way, viva la web!

To continue your Greenwood journey, here are some links we think you may want to check out next:

- [Docs](/docs/) - Review our docs to learn about configuration options, plugins, and more
- [Plugins](/docs/plugins/) - See ways to extend Greenwood with tools like TypeScript, CSS Modules, and more
- [Hosting](/guides/hosting/) - Guides on building and deploying your static, serverless, or serverfull application
- [Tutorials](/guides/tutorials/) - Additional walkthroughs and patterns using Greenwood

And of course feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/bsy9jvWh) and get involved with us in [GitHub](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood). ✌️
