  <p>Before closing out this guide, we hope you now have a good overview of Greenwood and its mechanics and how rooted Greenwood is in the web. This is why we say Greenwood is your workbench for web; we want to enable you to build however you want, with whatever you want, and wherever you want. Go all vanilla, or bring some friends along. Either way, viva la web!</p>
