# Going Further

Now that we've had a chance to introduce some of the [basics](/guides/getting-started/key-concepts/) of Greenwood and having [walked through](/guides/getting-started/walkthrough/) putting together a basic site, let's take a moment showcase some of the additional capabilities and use cases you can leverage in Greenwood.

## Prerendering

A fair observation from the walkthrough might be that the header and footer are really just producing static content. While the footer calculates a year, that really only needs to be done once at build time. Since Greenwood can easily server render Web Components leaning on [DOM based hydration techniques](https://web.dev/articles/declarative-shadow-dom#component_hydration), we can make a couple useful optimizations here.

First, we can enable the [`prerender`](/docs/config/#prerender) flag in a _greenwood.config.js_ file which will do a one-time server render for any custom element tags in our HTML.

```js
export default {
  prerender: true,
};
```

Now if we look in the HTML output for any of our pages, we will see pre-rendered HTML for the footer inside a `<template>` tag (this is Declarative Shadow DOM in action!):

```html
<app-footer>
  <template shadowrootmode="open">
    <style>
      /* ... */
    </style>
    <footer class="footer">
      <h4>
        <a href="https://www.greenwoodjs.io/">My Blog Â©2024 â—ˆ Built with GreenwoodJS</a>
      </h4>
    </footer>
  </template>
</app-footer>
```

We can go one step further and instruct Greenwood to strip out the `<script>` tags for these components by adding the `data-gwd-opt="static"` attribute to them, since we have no need for any interactivity on these components.

```html
<script type="module" src="../components/footer/footer.js" data-gwd-opt="static"></script>
<script type="module" src="../components/header/header.js" data-gwd-opt="static"></script>
```

And now, no JS bundles in the network tab either! With that, we just got the best of both worlds; JavaScript for developers, HTML for users. ðŸ’š

## Light DOM

While most of the examples so far have been using Shadow DOM, Greenwood is equally capable and encouraging of using Light DOM to render your (static / pre-rendered) Web Components. This is a great pattern to pair with when using something like [Tailwind](/guides/ecosystem/tailwind/) or our [CSS Modules plugin](/docs/plugins/css-modules/).

Instead of rendering into a Shadow Root, you can just render into `innerHTML`:

```js
export default class Header extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `
      <header class="pt-10">
        <a
          class="flex justify-center p-2"
          href="/"
          title="My Home page"
        >
          <img
            class="w-full h-full max-w-xs header-logo"
            src="/assets/my-logo.png"
            alt="My Logo"
            height="200"
            width="200"
          />
        </a>
      </header>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define("x-header", Header);
```

There is also the pattern of [**HTML Web Components**](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/html-web-components/), which can be another great option for combining global styles with "slotted" Light DOM content.

```js
export default class PictureFrame extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    const title = this.getAttribute("title");

    this.innerHTML = `
      <div class="picture-frame">
        <h6 class="heading">${title}</h6>
        ${this.innerHTML}
      </div>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define("app-picture-frame", PictureFrame);
```

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script type="module" src="../components/picture-frame.js"></script>
    <style>
      .picture-frame {
        width: fit-content;

        & h6 {
          text-decoration: underline;
        }
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <app-picture-frame title="My Logo">
      <img src="/assets/my-logo.webp" width="200" height="200" />
    </app-picture-frame>
  </body>
</html>
```

> As a general rule of thumb, if you need interactivity / hydration use Shadow DOM, if it's just for templating out static content, use a combination Light DOM + pre-rendering + static optimizations.
>
> Either way it's **your** DOM, use it how you need it.

## Content as Data

Greenwood also provides some general purpose helpers for more static driven sites (e.g. SSG) through our [content as data](/docs/content-as-data/) features, including a programmatic `Fetch` based API. When combined with [`activeFrontmatter`](/docs/config/) this enables HTML-first templating which can then be used to initialize attributes for custom element tags on a per page basis. Very useful for creating navigation menus and other sorts of collections of content, even with active link highlighting, no runtime JS needed! ðŸ’¯

For example, we can define some frontmatter in a markdown file:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```md
<!-- src/pages/blog/first-post.md -->
---
layout: blog
author: Project Evergreen
published: 2025-01-01
---

# My First Post

Lorum Ipsum
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

And access these values through HTML, like in a layout file:

```html
<!-- src/layouts/blog.html -->
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Site - ${globalThis.page.title}</title>
    <script type="module" src="../components/blog-post.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <app-blog-post
      title="${globalThis.page.title}"
      author="${globalThis.page.data.author}"
      published="${globalThis.page.published}"
    >
      <content-outlet></content-outlet>
    </app-blog-post>
  </body>
</html>
```

And the component might look like this:

```js
export default class BlogPost extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    const title = this.getAttribute("title");
    const author = this.getAttribute("author");
    const published = this.getAttribute("published");

    this.innerHTML = `
      <div class="blog-post">
        <h2 class="heading">${title}</h6>
        <h3 class="byline">
          <span>By: ${author}</span>
          <span>Published: ${published}</span>
        </h3>

        </hr/>

        ${this.innerHTML}
      </div>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define("app-blog-post", BlogPost);
```
