## Notes on Assets use
The following is a succinct guide on using the assets in the Design

- **Hero-Grid.svg**: 
This is used as a background image in the Hero section

- **Emphasis-splash.svg**:
This is used to draw emphasis on the npm code bash in the hero section

- **html.svg, api-routes.svg, build-ssg.svg, web-components.svg** are used as descriptive icons in the code snippets section

- **White-Grid.svg**:
This is used as a background image in `--color-secondary` backgrounds.

- `--color-gray-inner`:
This is used in any `—color-gray` container to create a subtle contrast.


**NOTE**:

- For Icons that appear multiple times, in different colors on the page, You can **“Copy as Svg” directly from Figma** and tweak the Svg in the Code.

In the “Build with Friends” section, the `—color-white` containers have a subtle shadow set to:
`box-shadow: 0px 4px 64px 2px #bdbdbd43;`

**E.g**

`.compatible-friends {
box-shadow: 0px 4px 64px 2px #bdbdbd43;
}`
